## About Business

Vertex Nexus Pvt Ltd  is a dynamic, multi-sector enterprise based in India. It operates across several high-impact industries and deals in multiple products.

## Objective

The Vertex Nexus sales team has observed several pressing issues impacting overall business growth:
- Stagnant Sales for Specific Products: Certain products have not shown consistent growth, prompting concerns about market relevance, pricing, or promotional strategy.
- Underperforming Geographic Areas: Specific regions are contributing below-average revenue, indicating potential issues in market penetration, channel effectiveness, or local demand.
- Limited Customer Segmentation Insight: The company seeks to better understand its customer base—particularly identifying high-value customers and behavioral patterns—to unlock new sales opportunities and refine targeting strategies
As a data analyst, my goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Vertex Nexus sales dataset to uncover insights and provide solutions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on sales data from **Vertex Nexus**, aimed at uncovering key trends Customer-wise, State-wise and Product-wise. This project demonstrates my Python data analysis workflow‚Äîfrom data cleaning to Analysis.

## üß† Overview

This project explores sales patterns to answer questions like:
- How do sales vary across different Customer Category?
- Which regions generate the most revenue?
- What product categories are driving growth?
- Which aspects should the company focus on to drive growth and improve sales?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python** üêç  
  - pandas for data manipulation  
  - matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations  
  - plotly for interactive charts  
- **Google Colab** for iterative analysis  
- **GitHub** for Project Presentation   


## About Business

Vertex Nexus Pvt Ltd  is a dynamic, multi-sector enterprise based in India. It operates across several high-impact industries and deals in multiple products.

## Objective

The Vertex Nexus sales team has observed several pressing issues impacting overall business growth:
- Stagnant Sales for Specific Products: Certain products have not shown consistent growth, prompting concerns about market relevance, pricing, or promotional strategy.
- Underperforming Geographic Areas: Specific regions are contributing below-average revenue, indicating potential issues in market penetration, channel effectiveness, or local demand.
- Limited Customer Segmentation Insight: The company seeks to better understand its customer base‚Äîparticularly identifying high-value customers and behavioral patterns‚Äîto unlock new sales opportunities and refine targeting strategies
As a data analyst, my goal is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Vertex Nexus sales dataset to uncover insights and provide solutions.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Removed the Status and unnamed1 column from the data as they were empty
- Removed Null Values from Amount Column
- Changed The Amount Column data type as integer

**Both Food and Clothing are bringing max number of orders and generating max revenue.
Identified Products which are not performing well - they should be analysed further to find problems and decide if the company should keep them or put their resources on categories with higher benefit.**

### Conclusion

**Unmarried woman in age group 26-35 years old from UP, Maharashtra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics Category.**

### Recommendations

1. More offers should be given to Unmarried women to boost sales and revenue as they are high ordering customers.
2. States where sales are lacking should be analysed further and targeted marketing campaigns should be done.
3. Products with higher sales should be kept in stock and their inventory levels should be in checks.
4. Products with minimal sales should be analysed if it is profitable for company to keep them or close them and these resources can be used to create products for different occupation-wise     customers to increase their engagement and trying to target different customer segments.
